        <!-- My song lyrics here, repeated -->
        Out of all the stars at night
        One thing I can't deny
        Still you that's shining bright
        I know I said some things
        You knew that I have tried
        To win you in my little ways
        Yeah, I've been like this
        That I've got no bliss
        Oh, without you by my side
        'Cause it's still you
        Daydreaming all the things we did
        All the hugs and kisses that I miss
        You know that I just can't resist you, my love
        'Cause it's still you
        You've shown me what I needed most
        God showed me all of it through you
        Still praying that you'd fight for this
        'Cause it's still you, my love
        Remember when we first met
        Stepped out of the bus
        I was in a rush to see you, oh
        And now look at us, we've done so much
        Shared memories that we've never ever imagined
        I think I'm dreaming, oh
        And now I'm like this
        I still have no bliss
        Oh, without you by my side
        'Cause it's still you
        Daydreaming all the things we did
        All the hugs and kisses that I miss
        You know that I just can't resist you, my love
        'Cause it's still you
        You've shown me what I needed most
        God showed me all of it through you
        Still praying that you'd fight for this
        'Cause it's still you, my love
        Oh, it's still you, my love
        'Cause it's still you
        Daydreaming all the things we did
        All the hugs and kisses that I miss
        You know that I just can't resist you, baby (I just can't, I just can't, I just can't)
        'Cause it's still you
        You've shown me what I needed most
        God showed me all of it through you
        Still praying that you'd fight for this
        'Cause it's still you, my love, oh
        It's still you, my love
